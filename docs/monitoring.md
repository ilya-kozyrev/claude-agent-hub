Interactively, `agent-top` adds a live feed per agent (thoughts ✎, commands ▸, results ◂), its brief and inbox, the
journal with a filter, and `m` / `x` to message or stop an agent after a y/N prompt.

### agent-top inside Claude Code: a live pane

Claude Code (mods are on by default) runs the plugin's mod, `hooks/agent-top.tsx`, in the terminal and in the
Desktop Code tab:

- **`/agent-top [role] [--stage S] [--all]` opens a pane**, and so does the `agents ● 4 ✓ 9 ✗ 0` button in the prompt
  footer next to the model picker; a second `/agent-top` or a second press closes it. The mod registers `/agent-top`
  itself and also answers `/agent-hub:agent-top`. It never opens by itself. Views: **Agents** (`a`; ↑/↓ move
  the `❯` cursor, Enter or the row's digit `1`–`9` opens the agent card), the **agent card** (state, model, turns, a
  context bar against the model's window, cost, result; a live feed of the last 30 events; `b` goes back), **Journal**
  (`j`) and **Summary** (`s`: plan-limit bars including Codex, owner questions, locks). Each agent is two lines with a
  coloured state badge (LIVE, QUIET, DONE, FAIL, DIED); a long list is a window around the cursor. Docked beside a
  fullscreen transcript the pane is framed and the card takes its state's colour; above the prompt and when narrow it
  drops the frames. It refreshes every 3 s while open; a role opens that agent's card; Esc closes it. Claude and Codex
  agents are listed alike, as in the console.
- **A status line and toasts.** The status line reads `agents ● 2 ✓ 5 ✗ 1` (nothing when there are no agents). A toast
  appears when an agent finishes, fails or dies and when a new owner question opens; what was already there when the
  session started is never announced. With the pane closed the mod looks every 15 s.
- **Read-only.** No send, stop or message button. The mod writes nothing: it runs `bin/agent-top --json` and draws the
  result. Messaging and stopping stay in the console (`m` / `x`) and in `agent send` / `agent stop`. `agent-top` itself
  writes one file, its read cache `<hub home>/.state/agent-top/cache.sqlite` (or under `$AGENT_HUB_STATE_DIR`): the
  log offsets of the last run, so the next one reads only what the logs gained. `AGENT_TOP_CACHE=0` turns it off.
- **When data is slow.** Each answer is drawn when it comes. A card whose call failed or took over 60 s says
  `feed unavailable: <reason> · retrying` in its feed area, and the next refresh asks again.
- **Where mods do not draw there is no `/agent-top`:** Codex, VS Code chat, `claude -p`, Remote Control and
  `claude --bg` views, Claude Code older than 2.1.287. Use the console in a shell: `agent-top` (live), `agent-top --once`
  (text picture), `agent-top --json` (scripts). If `bin/agent-top` is missing the mod goes quiet instead of failing.


## Watchdog: a hub that sleeps is woken

`watchdog` is a job that looks at every stage of the hub home every 5 minutes and acts when something waits and nobody
is looking. One run (a *tick*) reads, acts and exits: no daemon, no model call. It is off until `watchdog install`
(launchd on macOS, cron elsewhere; [setup](../skills/setup/SKILL.md) question 9 offers it). It also replaces the Claude
Desktop night nudge: open night-queue items inside `AGENT_HUB_NIGHT` count as waiting work, for every engine and host that
can be woken.

| Rule | Looks at | Does |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | An agent whose process is gone without a result. | The existing line `EXIT <role>: killed (no result)`, written once. |
| R2 | An open owner question past its due time that has a default. | One journal line `[watchdog] @hub OVERDUE Q-… (due …) default: …` per question and due date; a new due date re-arms it. |
| R3 | The hub is silent (not busy, no activity for 15 min), lines addressed to it have waited 15 min (or a night-queue item has, inside `AGENT_HUB_NIGHT`), and no `jwait` of its own runs. | Wakes the hub. |
| R4 | A Claude hub whose last turn ended on an API error 15 min ago or more, and which is not busy. | Wakes the hub, whether or not anything waits. |
| R5 | The machine, only when `AGENT_HUB_SPAWN_HOLD_LOAD` is set: the 1-minute load average per core above it. | Writes `<state dir>/spawn-hold.json`; see the load hold below. |

"Addressed to the hub" is what the hub's own digest `jwait` would deliver (its tags, its status words, not its own lines),
that no `jwait` of the hub has consumed (`.jwait-state/<caller>.json`, under its tag or its session id), stamped after
the hub took over. "No `jwait` of its own" is the file `.jwait-state/<stage>/<caller>.armed.json`, which `jwait --journal` writes
while it waits; a file whose process is gone is ignored and deleted. When a live waiter exists but lines still wait, the
watchdog does not wake: it writes one journal line (no status word, no `@`) saying that the waiter does not match them.
The watchdog's record lines (a wake, a failed wake, the mismatch above) carry no status word and no `@`, so they never count as waiting; the R2 line is addressed to the hub on purpose and does. Times are `AGENT_HUB_WATCHDOG_WAKE_AFTER` (15m).

### Which host is woken how

| Hub host | What the watchdog does |
|---|---|
| Headless hub (an agent of `agent spawn`) | `agent send --stage S <role> "<text>"` (resumes the same session). |
| `claude --bg` hub, idle | `claude stop <id>`, wait until the stopped session's process has exited, then `claude --bg --resume <full id> "<text>"`: the same session id, with no other flag. |
| `claude --bg` hub that is no longer listed | The same resume, when the hub was started in the background (`host: bg` in its `roles.json` record, else the pending record of `hub succeed` that started it) and the daemon still holds the session's saved options. |
| `claude --bg` hub that is busy | Nothing: it is not silent. |
| Desktop, terminal, a Claude session not started in the background, a Claude hub whose busy state cannot be read | A notification only. |
| Codex hub | A notification only in this release (the queue path in `bin/watchdog_codex.py` stays off until a hub record says `host: codex-app`). |

The wake text names the number of lines and the time they have waited since, tells the hub to run its digest `jwait` with
`--since` that time, handle what it shows and keep one waiter, and names `watchdog quiet`. After a stop and resume it adds
that the background commands of the hub's last turn were stopped. It carries no line text. It starts with
`[agent-hub watchdog]`, which the context-budget hook (both engines) recognises as agent-hub's own prompt: it does not
reset the autopilot's auto-handoff chain the way a prompt typed by the owner does.

### Safety

- **Never a successor.** The watchdog runs `agent send`, `claude stop` and `claude --bg --resume` of the hub's own
  session id. It never runs `hub succeed`, `agent spawn` or a `claude --bg` without `--resume`. Right before a resume it
  reads `claude agents --json` again; if the hub is listed busy it does not wake it, and if the CLI starts a copy of the
  session anyway, it stops the copy, counts the wake as failed and notifies; it does not resume a second time in the
  same tick, the next tick (after the backoff) does.
- **Do-not-wake marker.** `watchdog quiet --stage S --reason "…" [--for 8h | --until HH:MM|ISO]` writes
  `<stage>/do-not-wake.json` (who, when, until, reason); `watchdog quiet --stage S --clear` removes it; `watchdog quiet`
  alone lists every stage's marker. A marked stage gets no R3/R4 wake and no notification; R1 and R2 still write. An
  expired marker is removed by the next tick. The `hub takeover` digest shows an active marker.
- **One wake per episode.** An episode starts when the hub needs waking and ends when it shows activity after the last
  action, or nothing waits any more. The first wake is at once; later attempts wait 15, 30, 60, 120, 240 minutes
  (`AGENT_HUB_WATCHDOG_WAKE_AFTER` doubled each time, up to `AGENT_HUB_WATCHDOG_BACKOFF_MAX`, 4h); notifications follow
  the same schedule. A wake after which the hub shows no activity for 5 minutes counts as failed: a journal line, a
  notification `wake failed`. A failed wake has no other fallback and no successor.
- **A pending handoff.** A stage whose `auto-handoff.json` has a pending successor that has not taken over is skipped.
  When that record is older than `AGENT_HUB_SUCCESSOR_TIMEOUT` plus the wake time, the owner is notified once
  (`handoff stuck`) and nothing is started.
- **A replaced hub starts clean:** the state is keyed by the hub's session id.
- **One tick at a time:** a non-blocking lock on `<state dir>/watchdog/lock`; a second tick prints "another tick is
  running" and exits 0.
- **Dry run.** `watchdog run --dry-run [--stage S] [--json]` evaluates every rule and prints `[plan] …` lines, with
  ids shortened to 8 characters; it writes no journal line, no state, no marker, no `EXIT` and takes no lock, and sends
  no notification.

### The load hold (R5)

Off by default. With `AGENT_HUB_SPAWN_HOLD_LOAD` set (load per core, e.g. `1.5`), a tick whose 1-minute load average
divided by the core count is above it writes `<state dir>/spawn-hold.json` (`since`, `load`, `cores`, `until` = now +
two intervals) and refreshes it while the load stays high; it deletes the file once the load is below 80 % of the
threshold, and also when the setting is unset. `agent spawn` reads the file (ignored once `until` has passed or when it
cannot be read): by `AGENT_HUB_SPAWN_HOLD` it warns and goes on (`warn`, the default) or exits 1 (`refuse`), naming the
load, the cores, the threshold and `--ignore-hold`, which passes. Resumes (`agent send`) are never held: they continue
work that already exists. The job must be installed for the hold to be written; `watchdog run --dry-run` shows what a
tick would do.

### What leaves the machine

A notification carries the stage name, minutes, counts and an event word, for example `agent-hub: payments — hub silent 47
min, 3 lines waiting`; the other events are `last turn failed`, `wake failed` and `handoff stuck`. Never line text,
question text, session ids, tags or paths. Channels: the local one (macOS `osascript`, elsewhere `notify-send` when
present; `AGENT_HUB_NOTIFY_LOCAL`, on by default) and a remote one you configure, `AGENT_HUB_NOTIFY_CMD`, a JSON argv
in the hub home's `config.json` in which `{message}` is replaced and which runs without a shell:

```json
{ "AGENT_HUB_NOTIFY_CMD": ["curl", "-fsS", "-d", "{message}", "https://ntfy.sh/<topic>"] }
```

`watchdog notify-test` sends `agent-hub: test notification` through every channel and exits 1 when none exists or one fails.

### Install, status, uninstall

```bash
watchdog install [--scheduler launchd|cron]     # the job, and AGENT_HUB_WATCHDOG on in the hub home's config.json
watchdog status                                 # job, last tick, each stage's episode, markers, channels
watchdog run --dry-run                          # what a tick would do now
watchdog uninstall [--scheduler launchd|cron]   # removes the job and sets AGENT_HUB_WATCHDOG off
```

The job is `<state dir>/watchdog/run.sh`, which execs the plugin's `bin/watchdog run` with the hub home and the PATH
recorded at install time, and one launchd job `io.agent-hub.watchdog.<8 hex of the hub home's path hash>` (a plist in
`~/Library/LaunchAgents`) or one crontab line marked `# agent-hub-watchdog <hub home>`; several hub homes have one job each.
The shim records the plugin version that was installed, so **run `watchdog install` again after every plugin update**
(`watchdog status` says "install again" when the job points elsewhere). A change of `AGENT_HUB_WATCHDOG_EVERY` needs the
same. Files, all under `<state dir>/watchdog/` (`<hub home>/.state`, or `$AGENT_HUB_STATE_DIR`): `state.json`, `lock`,
`log.md` (one line per action, trimmed at 1 MB), `run.sh`, `job.log`. Settings:
[reference](reference.md#configuration).

### The probe: why the wake argv is what it is

A live probe on claude 2.1.289 (2026-10-07, a scratch `--bg` session) settled how a background session is woken. A
`--bg` session keeps its own saved options (model, effort, permission mode, remote control). `claude --bg --resume <id>
"<text>"` with the session not listed continued the same id and took the text as the prompt. The same command with any
flag (`--model` was tried) started a copy, and so did the same command while the session was listed idle. Hence the
order, stop the idle session, then resume it with no other flag, and the watchdog's check that nothing listed is
running and that no copy appeared.

A second probe (2026-10-07, 2.1.289) found one more window. After `claude stop` a session with Remote Control drops out of
`claude agents --json` about 1.7 s before its process has exited and the daemon has released it; a resume in that window
started a copy (4 of 4), a resume after the stopped row's pid had exited continued the same id (3 of 3). The watchdog
therefore waits for that process to exit (up to 30 s, polling every 0.2 s) before it resumes. The process is identified
by its pid and its start time (a reused pid is another process). If it is still there after the wait, the watchdog keeps
its identity in the hub's state (`state.json`, `hub.stopped`) and does not resume in this tick, nor in any later tick
(also not when the hub is no longer listed) until that process is seen gone. Once released it reads `claude agents --json`
once more: a hub listed again (the owner resumed it meanwhile) cancels the wake. A stopped row without a pid cannot be
checked, so there is no resume in that tick; the next tick resumes the then unlisted hub.
