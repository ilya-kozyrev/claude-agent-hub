"""SessionStart hook: one line when a command of the same name as one of the plugin's tools (any executable of its bin/:
hub, jlog, jwait, agent, ask, roles, lock, …) comes before the plugin's bin/ on PATH — GitHub CLI `hub` from Homebrew is
the usual one. The agent-hub commands then run the other program, and an agent's `jlog` writes to a journal the hub never
reads.

Also keeps $HUB_BIN, which the briefs and tools call as "$HUB_BIN/jlog", pointing at this plugin's bin/: a `claude --bg`
session gets the environment of the long-running Claude Code daemon, and with it the HUB_BIN of whichever plugin version
was current when the daemon started, so a background hub would run an old jlog and jwait. When $HUB_BIN is unset or points
elsewhere the hook appends `export HUB_BIN=<the bin/> of the plugin copy it belongs to` (its own location; an inherited
PLUGIN_ROOT is ignored, and a CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT naming another copy makes it leave HUB_BIN alone) to $CLAUDE_ENV_FILE (Claude Code runs that file before every
Bash command of the session; without the variable — Codex — nothing is written) and, if it replaced a stale value, says so
in one line.

Reads PATH as this hook process sees it; nothing is run. Does nothing, and writes nothing, until a hub home exists
(<hub home>: `hub start` creates it): a machine that never ran a hub is left alone.
Scope as in questions.py: a session that starts in the hub home, in a repository with `.agent-hub/`, under
AGENT_HUB_SCOPE_DIRS, or as a hub agent (HUB_TAG) hears it every time; a session elsewhere (a first project that has no `.agent-hub/` yet) hears it once per distinct set of shadowing
paths, remembered in <state dir>/path-shadow/seen (AGENT_HUB_STATE_DIR, default <hub home>/.state). Fail-open: any
error of its own -> exit 0 with no output.
