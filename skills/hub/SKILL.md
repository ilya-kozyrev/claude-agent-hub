name: hub
description: Tools and recommended rules for a stage hub — the one interactive session that plans a stream of work and runs headless Claude Code or Codex agents. Load it when you are the hub of a stage, when starting a stage, taking over or handing off a hub shift, when spawning or messaging a long-running background agent, when you need a review of a change, and when you need to wait for events — journal lines, an agent's status, a script's question, an alarm. Also load it when the user mentions agent-hub or "the hub skill", or asks you to plan work for agents or to run work through agents.

# Stage hub: tools and recommended rules

## Host and engine

Run the bundled tools through the host's shell tool. Resolve the plugin root from `PLUGIN_ROOT` (Codex),
`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` (Claude), or this installed skill's location (two directories above `skills/hub`).
Use that root's `bin/<tool>` when a command is missing or shadowed on PATH. `HUB_BIN` is set in detached workers.
Template and documentation paths below are relative to this root.
For installation assessment or task routing, read `<plugin-root>/docs/agents/README.md`;
this skill owns the stage workflow once the plugin is selected.

Choose the executor engine before choosing a model. Offer the owner one engine choice during initial stage planning:
Codex, Claude, or a mixed team, with the coordinator's current host as the default. An existing explicit choice
already answers this question; otherwise proceed with the host default while awaiting an optional preference.
Record the choice in the stage's `hub-rules.md` and carry it into briefs and handoffs. A Codex hub defaults to
Codex executors; a Claude hub defaults to Claude executors. Choose each worker's model and effort within that
engine. Claude model names in general task-sizing advice apply to Claude workers; using such advice to switch
engines requires an explicit engine choice from the owner. Reviewer engines may follow an explicitly configured
review policy.

Pass the chosen engine explicitly with `agent spawn --engine claude|codex`. Without that flag, `AGENT_HUB_ENGINE`
can supply a configured default; otherwise the launcher detects a Codex host through `CODEX_THREAD_ID` and falls
back to Claude in an ordinary terminal. Native subagents run in their host; mixed teams use detached executors.
Codex uses its configured model when `--model` is omitted; pass an actual available model id or an explicit
`AGENT_HUB_CODEX_MODEL_MAP` alias. Claude aliases stay Claude-only. Read `docs/codex.md` for installation,
hook trust, full access, and native worker setup. Full access keeps the lock hooks active.

## First commands

Do these before anything else, in this order:

1. `hub start --stage <S> --goal "<goal>" --session self` — S names the work in 1–3 words and the goal is one line in
   the owner's words (*Starting a stage*). If the task gives no goal, ask the owner for that line first, as the first
   question of the grilling; never invent one. If
   `hub` answers with an error such as `invalid choice` or `not a git command`, another `hub` (GitHub CLI) is ahead of
   the plugin's on PATH: run `<plugin-root>/bin/hub start …` and tell the owner in one line.
2. `ask search <words of the goal>` — decisions already on record are settled.
3. Establish the Business DoD, then plan and brief (*Planning a stage*). A clear owner request can already
   supply the agreed result and the owner's yes to the plan; ask only about business-material ambiguity.
   Honor an explicit request to approve the plan before starting.

A **stage** is one stream of work (a release, a migration, a sprint) with its own directory under the hub home
(`$AGENT_HUB_HOME`, else a repository's `.agent-hub/config.json` `"project"` / `"user"`, else `~/agent-hub`; `hub home`
prints where it is and why, and how to grant a session access to it; if `hub start` warns that it is the legacy
`~/.claude/agent-hub`, tell the owner in one line — `hub home migrate` moves it, a dry run first). The **hub** is the
one interactive session that plans the stage, writes briefs, spawns headless agents and answers them. The **owner** is
the person the hub works for. Everything they share is a file:

| File | Written by | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| `<stage>/coordinator/work/journal-YYYY-MM-DD.md` — one line per event, `- HH:MM [tag] text` | `jlog`, `tell`, `agent`, `hub`, `roles broadcast` | `jwait`, `agent-top`, humans |
| `<stage>/agents/<role>/` — `brief.md`, `inbox.md`, `log.jsonl`, `meta.json` | `agent spawn/send` and the selected CLI run | `agent status`, `agent-top` |
| `<stage>/roles.json` — who plays which role, by full session id | `roles`, `agent`, `hub start/takeover` | `roles`, `jlog` (tag lookup) |
| `<stage>/questions.md` — owner questions and agents' own decisions | `ask` | `ask`, SessionStart hook, `hub` digest |
| `board.md` — locks on shared resources (merges to main and whatever the project names) | `lock`, `hub takeover` | the `board_locks` hook |

The hooks add `<plugin-root>/bin` to PATH when enabled and trusted. An older
command of the same name — GitHub CLI `hub` from Homebrew, an old `jlog` — can answer instead; if `hub start` or the
session start says so, call the tools as `<plugin-root>/bin/<tool>` and tell the owner in one line. Each has
`--help` with the full syntax. Stage: `--stage`, else `$HUB_STAGE`, else `default`. The hub's tag is `hub-<N>` (N = shift number, derived).

**Minimal mode.** One hub and a few agents need `hub start` once (it gives the hub its journal tag) and then three
tools: `agent` (spawn, status, send, stop), `jlog` and `jwait`. `roles`, `ask`, `lock`, `tell` (a line to another stage's hub), `hub takeover/handoff` and the
handoff skill matter once you have more than one interactive session, more than one shift, or a shared resource;
leave them until then.

## Starting a stage

`hub start --stage <S> --goal "<goal>" --session <your full session id>` — once, by the first hub of a new stage: creates
the stage directory, registers you as `hub-1`, writes the start line and prints the first `jwait`. Use `--session self`;
the tool resolves the current host's session identity (`CODEX_THREAD_ID` in Codex, `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`
in Claude, or `AGENT_SESSION_ID` in a detached worker). In Claude Desktop you may pass the `local_…` id.
An ordinary shell must pass an actual full session id. Offer `agent-hub:setup` if the project has no `.agent-hub/` yet.
Follow warnings about shadowed tools or an outdated CLI.

**Names say what the work is.** The stage name is the goal in 1–3 words (`retro-fixes`, `yc-move`), never `hub-09`,
`stage-2`, `wave-a` or `wp3`: `hub start` refuses a name made only of generic words (hub, stage, wave, wp, task, work,
test, tmp, new, default, stream, sprint — `AGENT_HUB_GENERIC_STAGE_WORDS` sets the list), numbers and single letters
(exit 2), and refuses a start without `--goal`. The goal line goes into your title (`Hub <stage> #N — <goal>`), the
takeover digest, the handoff and `agent-top`. Agent roles follow the same rule: `--role mainmerge-fix`, `argv-off`,
never a number or a package id (`wp23`), so the journal, `agent-top` and other stages' hubs read what each one does.
A stage that already carries a poor name is renamed with `hub rename --stage OLD --to NEW` (`--dry-run` first) once none
of its agents is alive; `hub takeover --goal "…"` gives an older stage a goal line.

A hub works in a fresh worktree of its project, never in the project's main clone and never outside git. When the
command exits 4 with `MOVE <path>`, move as it prints — Claude Code: `EnterWorktree` with `path=<path>`, and if it refuses
(the session was launched outside the repository, e.g. a Desktop session under "No folder")
`mcp__ccd_directory__change_directory` with that path (it takes effect when the turn ends: use absolute paths until then);
Codex: run every later command with that workdir — then run the command line it prints again. `NO PROJECT`: find the
project the task is about (its main clone under `~/repos/`, or where the brief points) and re-run with
`--repo <main clone>`; `--no-project` is only for a stage that has no repository at all.

## Taking over a shift

1. `hub takeover --stage <S> --session <your full session id | self> [--handoff <file>]` — one command (`self` = this
   session's host identity, read by the tool): the previous hub's
   locks (`--skip-lock <resource>` if its executor still works under that lock; `--take-main-merge` to take the merge
   role too, from anyone; `AGENT_HUB_TAKE_MAIN_MERGE=true` in the repository's config takes it only when it is free or
   held by an earlier hub of your own stage — never from another stage's hub, and never on `hub start`), `roles set hub`, a
   start line in the journal (and `coordinator:` of the night queue, if the stage has one). Your number is the
   registered hub's + 1 (or the successor named in the handoff); `--n` overrides. A step that does not verify stops
   the command and names the step; a re-run finishes the rest. `--dry-run` first if unsure.
2. The takeover digest (≤ 3 KB) puts § 0 of the handoff next to the `ask` register. Check every "the owner said" in the
   handoff against the register. If they disagree, the register wins; ask the owner.
3. Start the first `jwait` — the ready command is in the digest; its `--since` (the handoff time) delivers the lines
   written during the handover.
4. Read the project's hub rules and notes before planning (the digest names them): `hub-rules.md` (overrides of the
   recommended rules below) and `HUB-NOTES.md` (what the team knows: what goes to the owner, how data claims are
   checked). `hub takeover` has the same location rule as `hub start` (the paragraph under *Starting a stage*): exit 4
   with `MOVE <path>` or `NO PROJECT` means move or add `--repo`, then run it again — nothing was registered before.
   When the replaced hub is a background session that is not busy, the command stops it (`claude stop`, history kept) and
   says so; if it names a Desktop hub that still runs and you have `mcp__ccd_session_mgmt__archive_session`, archive that
   session with it (a busy one or a terminal one is only named: leave it to the owner).

Leaving: `hub handoff --stage <S>` writes a `HANDOFF-hub-*.md` draft with the facts filled in and TODOs; fill the TODOs
(skill `handoff`; `hub handoff --finish` refuses a draft with TODO left in § 0–2, and `hub succeed` checks the same). Locks are not released — the successor's `hub takeover` takes them. It first looks for sub-agents of
your own session (`--session`, else the registered hub's and the session you run it in) that still run and refuses —
exit 2, listing id, description and age — because they die with you and the successor cannot message them; the ways out
are under *Choosing how to launch work*.

**Autopilot** (`AGENT_HUB_AUTO_HANDOFF=on`): at a quiet point (no agent awaiting your reply or lock operation
in flight), write/fill `hub handoff`, then run the budget message's `hub succeed … --handoff <draft>` yourself.
Codex `--surface auto` selects a native desktop request only in an actual app hub (both app markers, no detached
worker role); a console hub uses the detached CLI path. `--surface cli` or `--headless` explicitly chooses CLI.
For a desktop request, immediately follow [the native launch procedure](../../docs/codex.md#desktop-autopilot)
in this app session: list_projects, desktop-request, create_thread, desktop-bind; use desktop-fail for a failure.
This is the current agent's procedure. The owner does not run a setup wizard. Keep the predecessor active until
`desktop-status --verified` succeeds after the actual successor's takeover. A clientThreadId confirms a pending
creation, never a real session. A timeout or uncertain API result keeps the same request; no hidden CLI fallback.

For CLI/Claude launch, continue the printed `jwait` through the host procedure below. Its start line → tell the
owner the successor's name and returned link/send command, then stop; release no locks. Claude background ALARM →
`hub succeed --stage <S> --fallback`; detached ALARM → `--again` only after `agent status` confirms the successor
is dead. Chain limit (exit 3) → tell the owner the handoff path and stop. Other errors retain the handoff and explain
the failed step. A desktop permission failure leaves the predecessor active; APIs cannot set Full Access.

If effort cannot be determined, retain the handoff and use `hub effort`; never guess `--effort`.
A CLI/Claude successor that needs replacement uses `hub succeed --replace` (main's verified stop/relaunch protocol),
never a bare launcher; run it yourself, never from a sub-agent.

An automatic successor prompt carries `[agent-hub auto-handoff k/N]`: run its takeover command, then work the finite
handoff queue to its completion/stop checks. Wait only while work or external events remain. When the queue is done,
journal DONE and finish. Questions go to `ask add` with a default; hand over again when your budget requires it.

## Waiting

Waiting is **one** `jwait`, using the shell harness rather than a polling loop.
- **Claude Code:** run Bash with `run_in_background: true`, `timeout: 3600000` and the digest's `--for` (55m by
  default, `AGENT_HUB_JWAIT_FOR`). The prompt cache lives one hour: a wake after a longer sleep re-writes the whole
  context into it, so a longer wait costs more than it saves. The Bash `timeout` stays at or above `--for`. Its
  completion notification wakes the coordinator.
- **Codex:** use the shell tool's yielded execution session and its continuation/wait tool. Keep each blocking
  tool wait at most 60 seconds so the coordinator can respond, and do independent work before continuing it.
  Preserve the returned execution id; use the tool's exit code to distinguish an event, an alarm, and a failure.
  A terminal session that cannot continue a shell command asynchronously should use a bounded foreground
  `jwait` and handle its result before starting another. A detached successor uses the same foreground procedure.

A stopped `jwait` loses no lines once its caller has run before: the next one delivers them.
- `jwait --journal --tag hub-<N> --tag hub --match '\b(MERGED|STOP|DONE|BLOCKED|EXIT|QUESTION|ENDED|REVIEWED)\b|AWAITING ANSWER' --for 55m` —
  lines addressed to the hub, agents' status lines and script questions echoed into the journal. Your own lines (your
  tag and its sub-tags `hub-<N>/…`) do not wake you. The digest prints this command with the team's extra wake words
  (`AGENT_HUB_JWAIT_MATCH`) already added; copy it from there. `--for` defaults to 55m (`AGENT_HUB_JWAIT_FOR`; wait again after the alarm). Called with
  `--caller <session id>` instead of as the hub's tag (no `HUB_TAG`, no registry entry for the session), `jwait` does not know your tag: add `--exclude-tag hub-<N>`, or your own `@agent` messages
  wake you.
- `jwait --file <script output> --match 'AWAITING ANSWER'` — a script's question; one asked before `jwait` started is
  delivered too.
- `jwait --until 20:23 --note "check the nightly import"` — an alarm; exit 3 and a line `ALARM …`. `--until` also takes
  `HH:MM:SS` and an ISO time with seconds (`2026-10-04T20:23:30`); `HH:MM` still means that minute's start.
- Sources and filters combine in one command. What was read is remembered: lines that arrived while you worked come
  with the next `jwait`.

Wake up — handle the block — start the next `jwait`. Journal waits and alarms use `jwait`; keep one waiter and continue it through the shell harness.

## Talking

- `jlog "text"` — a journal line with your tag (`--tag`, `$HUB_TAG` or the registry). The journal is append-only:
  never rewrite or delete a line; correct it with a new line that says what it corrects. When you write into another
  stage's journal, do not sign as `hub`: that stage's `jwait --tag hub` treats `hub` lines as its own and does not wake.
  `jlog` signs a foreign-journal line `<your stage>-<tag>` (`[core-c-hub-30]`); your `jwait --tag hub-30` hears the
  answer `@core-c-hub-30`.
- To another stage's hub write in its journal: `tell <stage> "…"` (`--question` for a question) — it addresses `@hub`
  and signs you correctly. The answer reaches you only in your own journal: the other hub answers with
  `tell <your stage> "…"`; its `jwait` does not read your journal. A headless agent reads its inbox, so `tell` hands
  the text to `agent send` itself.
- A direct cross-session message only when the journal cannot do (for example the other hub must act before its next
  wake-up), and only to the address from `tell <stage> --address` / `roles --stage <stage> get hub` — never to a session
  chosen by its name in a list (`ListAgents` or `codex agents`): a replaced hub can still run under the same name.
  Codex: use the printed `agent send` for a detached hub, or `codex queue --thread <registered UUID> --message "…"`
  when the CLI supports `queue`; use the UUID, never a display name.
- `roles list | get <role> | set <role> <id> | retire` — the stage's role registry with full session ids; `set` infers
  the kind from the id (`local_…` = Claude Desktop, a uuid = terminal). For Claude cross-session messaging, resolve the address with `roles get <role>`.
  For detached workers of either engine, use `agent send`; Codex has no Claude `SendMessage` API. `roles broadcast --to r1,r2|--all "text"` — registered recipients and one journal line `@r1 @r2 text`.
- Owner-question register: `ask search <words…>` — decisions the owner already took on a topic; `ask digest` — the
  whole register, one line per decision; `ask add … --default … --due …` — a new question with the action you will
  take if nobody answers; `ask decided` — a decision you took yourself on a matter the owner normally decides;
  `ask close <id> --answer …` — the owner answered; `ask done <id> --evidence "…"` — the answer was executed;
  `ask list --pending` — answers without `done`.
- Standing permissions (`<plugin-root>/docs/standing-permissions.md`): `ask allow --list --stage <S>` — what the owner
  already allowed for this stage's repository, recorded in any stage (the start/takeover digest lists them); `ask allow
  --stage <S> --class "<keywords>" --words "<the owner's words>" "<the class of action>"` — record one (`--repo` when
  the action touches another repository — its path or remote URL; `--scope stage|all`; `--until`); `ask revoke
  <A-id>`. Use specific keywords (`deploy-staging`, not `deploy`, when the words are about staging). Ask with `ask add
  --repo <each repository the action touches> --class <every class of the action>`: a question the permissions cover
  on every repository is refused (exit 3) and prints the owner's words — act under them only if they cover this
  case's specifics (environment, scope, what is touched) and journal the id; if they do not, `--override "why"`.
  Money, migrations and permissions/RBAC are covered only by a permission that names them.
- Owner digest: on the owner's first message after a long silence run `ask inbox --if-quiet` and open your reply with
  its output, then answer; it prints nothing while the owner's last recorded answer is newer than
  `AGENT_HUB_OWNER_DIGEST_AFTER` (3h by default), so empty output means go straight to the reply. Show it once per
  silence, not on every message; `ask inbox` on request at any time (`--stage S` for one stage, `--since 6h`). Every
  question you put to the owner says what each answer changes: "A: …; B: …" with the consequence of each, and the
  default you take if no answer comes.

## Planning a stage: agree the business result before autonomous work

**Business DoD** is a short, ordinary-language description of the expected user or business result, clear enough
for the owner to leave the work to autopilot. Usually a short paragraph is enough. Use the owner's useful constraints
and any detailed specification they supplied; a full scenario, button design, numeric target or fixed schema is not
required. Detailed UI, scenario and technical design belong to the hub and executor unless supplied by the owner.
This recipe applies to Claude and Codex, in the console and app.

1. `ask search <topic words>` and `ask allow --list --stage <S>` — decisions and permissions already on record are
   settled; do not ask them again. For a successor or executor, preserve the inherited Business DoD and its source.
   When the stage's repository has no standing permission, run the short analysis of
   `<plugin-root>/skills/setup/SKILL.md` § 5 (what the project merges, deploys and releases; the owner's level) and add
   one grilling round about them; record each answer with `ask allow`.
2. If the expected business result is unclear, use the companion `grilling` skill (`mattpocock-skills`, see `<plugin-root>/docs/install.md#recommended-companion-grilling`):
   rounds of numbered questions, each with a recommended answer. **For this hub workflow, limit its exhaustive
   decision-tree method to ambiguity whose answer materially changes the business result; stop once that result is
   clear.** Facts and implementation choices are agent-owned: research them and proceed with work that has no
   business blocker. If the companion is unavailable, mention its installation instructions once and use
   the same question method yourself.
3. Record owner answers with `ask add` then `ask close --answer …`; meaningful unresolved product branches go to
   the owner and register. Follow the existing register/default policy for blocked work. Agent decisions remain
   agent-owned; record the hub's choices with `ask decided` so they remain contestable.
4. Put the agreed Business DoD in the existing plan or brief, with a source link or register reference. A clear owner
   request can itself be the agreed DoD: restate it briefly and proceed within its authorization, without another
   interview or approval solely for adding a DoD heading or file. If your proposal materially changes the business
   scope or result, obtain owner agreement first. Before spawning, have a plan the owner said yes to: a clear,
   detailed request counts as that yes. Honor an explicit request to approve the plan before starting. Record the
   approved plan with `ask plan --stage <S> "<plan in one line>"` (`agent spawn` warns when the stage has none).
5. Brief executors with that source or a concise inherited result. Keep implementation steps, technical verification
   and stop/permission conditions separate. Later executors and hub shifts carry the same result through handoffs;
   they choose details independently and raise only new ambiguity that materially changes the business result.

For an owner who is not technical, one question is mandatory: "How will you open the result, and where should it live?",
with a recommendation. For something that runs in a browser, recommend a static site (for example GitHub Pages),
not "run a server on your Mac": a server dies with the laptop and the owner cannot restart it. Hand the result over
with a clickable local file or web link, or open it yourself (`open <path>` on macOS).

Put questions in the owner's words, about the product and what they will see. Purely technical choices (canvas or
DOM, localStorage, branch names) belong to the hub: decide and record them with `ask decided`.

Completion is judged against the agreed business result. Reports state what users actually received and how that
matches the result, with executor-owned technical evidence separately. Green CI alone does not prove business
completion. Existing merge, production, money and external-action permission policies still apply.

Ask the owner nothing about process: agents or not, worktrees, commits. Pick the launch by the criteria of "Choosing
how to launch work". If you write a change yourself, say why in one line and record it with `ask decided`.

## Choosing how to launch work

Decide from what is visible before the start — what the work does and who must reach it. The first "yes" decides
(table, modes and the experiments behind them: `<plugin-root>/docs/launch-modes.md`). Estimated duration is a
hint, never the criterion: a hub cannot estimate task time reliably. The owner is not asked which launch to use. When
no row applies — a small change with nothing to wait on and nobody else to reach it — the hub may write it itself: one
line with the reason, and `ask decided` (*Planning a stage*).

1. **A review** → `hub reviewer --for <class>`, then start what it prints (*Reviews*, below).
2. **The owner should talk to it** → an interactive session in their chosen host. Claude additionally supports
   `claude --bg`; Codex detached workers are reached through `agent send` or a separate CLI resume after they stop.
3. **It commits or pushes, waits on CI, a deploy or another party, touches production, or must be reachable by
   someone other than this hub** → `agent spawn`. Always so when the hub is near its handoff threshold.
4. **Read-only, the answer is a short digest, nothing external to wait on** (read a log, check a fact, probe an
   environment, summarise a file) → a sub-agent: **foreground** when the hub has nothing else to do until the answer,
   otherwise **background** (through the host's native subagent API).

- An in-session sub-agent depends on the host's session lifecycle; its native follow-up API is for that session.
  Use a detached executor when a successor must reach or resume it. In Claude, compaction preserves the sub-agent. Ask it for a short result (≤ 20 lines,
  details in a file): its completion notice and result land in your context.
- **Every sub-agent brief ends with a call budget:** "if not done after N tool calls, stop and return a partial result
  and what is left". Recommended N: 40 for a probe or a read, up to 80 for a wide read-only investigation; it is a
  recommendation, set yours in `hub-rules.md`. *Why:* nobody watches a sub-agent; without a bound a confused one runs
  until its context is full, and the hub pays for it.
- **`hub handoff` refuses while a sub-agent of your session still runs** (exit 2; it lists id, description and age).
  Three ways out, per sub-agent: wait for it (its notice is minutes away); stop it and re-launch the rest with
  `agent spawn`, with its brief and the partial result; or record it as lost — `hub handoff --allow-live-subagents`
  writes the list into the draft's TODO section.
- Its shell inherits your `HUB_TAG`: if it journals, one final line `jlog --tag hub-<N>/<name> "DONE <path>"` (your
  `jwait` ignores your sub-tags; the notice wakes you). An executor's sub-agents do not journal — its `DONE` reports
  for them, and any `DONE` line wakes the hub.
- A headless agent may use native sub-agents. For Claude, `agent spawn` lifts its 10-minute wait ceiling
  (`AGENT_HUB_BG_WAIT_CEILING_MS`); Codex uses its own native subagent lifecycle. `agent-top` lists the sub-agents of registered sessions as `<role>/<id>`, read-only.

### Reviews

For Sol-authored code, choose a judgement reviewer: Claude Opus/Fable at high effort when its limits allow,
otherwise an available Codex Astra at high. A different or older Sol is not the default reviewer for Sol.
Reviewer engine choice is separate from the implementation engine; this review policy can select Claude for a
Codex implementation. Check the chosen engine's available models and limits before launch, record the reviewer
choice in stage rules and its brief, and honour the owner's explicit reviewer policy. For a Claude author,
use its configured independent Fable or Codex reviewer. One reviewer is sufficient.
The hub writes the review brief and launches the reviewer itself; the author of the change does neither (an author
briefing its own reviewer steers it to what the author already checked). For money, masking and permissions the brief
is narrowed to that risk (the template's "Look hardest at") and leaves style out.

`hub reviewer --for <class>` walks the configured reviewers (`AGENT_HUB_REVIEWERS`, default one ordinary `agent
spawn`) and prints the first that is available now and exactly how to start it: an `agent spawn --role review-… --brief
<BRIEF>` line, or "load skill `<skill>`" for a reviewer skill the user plugged in. Write the brief from
`<plugin-root>/templates/brief-review.md`, start the reviewer as printed, and **verify each finding against the
code** before acting on it — a review is a colleague's opinion. Classes, the config, the skill reviewer contract:
`<plugin-root>/docs/reviewers.md`.
Configure the list in this order with availability checks for limited reviewers; if a legacy entry selects a
Sol reviewer for Sol-authored work, bring that entry into line with the approved policy before using its command.

## Executors

- Work that commits, pushes or waits (a merge steward, a rehearsal, a CI wait — see "Choosing how to launch work") is
  a headless agent, not an in-session sub-agent:
  `agent spawn --engine claude|codex --role R --cwd DIR [--model MODEL] [--effort high] --brief FILE [--worktree [BRANCH]]`.
  It survives the hub's handoff and any hub can talk to it. The executor's tag is `hub-<N>-<role>` (a sub-tag
  `hub-<N>/…` would be filtered out of your own `jwait`; `agent spawn` refuses it). A run that ends abnormally leaves
  `EXIT <role>: …` in the journal under its tag; one that ends normally without a status word of its own, `ENDED <role>: …`
  (`REVIEWED <role>: …` for a review role) — the agent stopped, nothing is wrong.
  `agent status [R]` — alive or not, the model it runs on, age of the last event, turns (the last run's next to the total
  after a resume), the last line it said, its worktree.
  `agent send R "…"` — alive: into its inbox and the journal; process gone: the session resumes with this message and
  replays the unread inbox. `agent stop R` — stop it and retire the role. An agent's question arrives as
  `@hub QUESTION …`; answer with `agent send`.
- **Background processes.** An executor lists the processes it started in the background (servers, watchers) in its
  report and stops them before `DONE`. At handoff the hub checks for listening ports left by the project
  (`lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN`) and stops what the project started and nobody needs.
- **Worktrees.** Two agents writing in one checkout overwrite each other's files. Give every agent that writes code
  `--worktree [BRANCH]` (default branch `agent/<role>`): it runs in an existing worktree of that branch, or in
  `<repo>/.worktrees/<branch>` of the main repository — one place per repository, excluded in `.git/info/exclude`.
  A new branch starts from origin's default branch (fetched first), not from the commit `--cwd` has checked out — which
  may be someone's feature branch; `--base REF` chooses another start (`--base HEAD` for the checked-out commit).
  `agent spawn --worktree` refuses a repository with no commits: in a new, empty one the hub makes the first commit
  itself and says so in one line.
  Nothing removes a worktree; at handoff list them (`git worktree list`) and remove the finished ones
  (`git worktree remove <path>`).
- Model and effort: choose per agent. Claude supports `opus|sonnet|haiku|fable` aliases and optional
  `AGENT_HUB_MODEL_MAP` pins. Codex supports available model ids and optional `AGENT_HUB_CODEX_MODEL_MAP` aliases;
  omit the model to use `AGENT_HUB_CODEX_DEFAULT_MODEL` or the CLI configuration. Choose effort supported by that model.
  Before the first detached Codex launch for a selected CLI/model in a stage, check that CLI's `--version` and
  `debug models` catalog (use `CODEX_BIN` when configured), including its configured default when omitting `--model`.
  Desktop model availability does not establish standalone CLI availability. Ordinary implementation uses an
  available Sol-family model, subject to the owner's explicit model choice. Resolve an unavailable Sol version by
  checking CLI compatibility or selecting an available Sol peer and reporting the fallback. Reserve Astra for a
  task whose judgement needs justify it, stating the reason before launch; a startup/model error is a compatibility
  issue rather than a reason to raise the task's model class. Keep the chosen engine through this recovery.
  `AGENT_HUB_PERMISSION_MODE=bypassPermissions` is the headless default: Claude uses its bypass mode, Codex uses
  `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`. For Codex read-only review, pass `--sandbox read-only` instead.
  Codex hook trust is separate: see `docs/codex.md`; read the returned errors when a restricted operation fails.
- A brief follows `<plugin-root>/templates/brief-executor-template.md` (short); the advanced one,
  `brief-executor-advanced.md`, adds production permissions, size limits and evidence rules for teams that need them.
  The hub fills "Owner decisions — do not reopen" from `ask search <topic words>`. When an executor's result disagrees
  with a recorded decision, the hub checks that section before asking the owner.

## Locks

A lock is on a named resource. `main-merge` is built in: merges into, and pushes to, the protected branches are
refused to everyone but its holder. Every other resource — a deploy window, a staging environment, a migration head,
a shared test database — is named by the project in `lock-rules.json` (`<repo>/.agent-hub/` or the hub home), with
the commands that touch it. `lock rules` lists what applies where you are; `lock take <resource> --until … --why …`
refuses a name nobody configured and prints the known ones; `lock rules check "<command>"` shows which lock would
refuse a command. To set the resources up, use the `agent-hub:setup` skill.

## Project configuration

A repository can carry its own hub conventions in `<repo>/.agent-hub/` (the hub home and `<hub home>/<stage>/` hold
the same files): `config.json` (defaults: model map, effort, permission mode, the lock repo, the reviewers), `lock-rules.json`
(shared resources and their commands), `brief-footer.md` (appended to every brief of an agent spawned with `--cwd` in
that repository), `handoff-facts.sh` (the § 1 rows of `hub handoff`), `takeover.sh` (an extra verified step of
`hub takeover`), `hub-rules.md` (overrides of the recommended rules below) and `HUB-NOTES.md` (the team's knowledge).
Read `hub-rules.md` from every layer — hub home, then the repository, then the stage directory; a later file wins on
the same subject — and `HUB-NOTES.md` before planning at all.

## Recommended hub rules

These are the defaults of the plugin's author, each paid for by an incident or a bill. Follow them unless
`hub-rules.md` says otherwise; a rule there replaces the one below on the same subject and adds anything new
(example: `<plugin-root>/templates/hub-rules-example.md`).

1. **Agents stay silent between events.** An executor writes to the hub only `DONE` (finished), `BLOCKED` (cannot go
   on), `STOP` (its brief's stop condition hit), `MERGED` (a merge steward merged a PR) or a `QUESTION`: the status
   word, the report path and one sentence; the full report is `work/<tag>-REPORT.md`. *Why:* every line wakes the hub,
   and every wake-up re-reads the hub's whole context.
2. **A wake-up with nothing new is a turn of "no action"**, without analysis. *Why:* the same — a hub that thinks
   aloud on every wake-up spends its context on nothing.
3. **Work that commits or pushes, waits on something external, touches production or must be reachable by others is a
   headless agent.** *Why:* an in-session sub-agent belongs to its parent session — another session cannot address it
   and it does not carry over to the next hub; a headless one has its own session id, keeps working through a handoff
   and any hub can message it.
4. **A change to a production script is written by an executor and reviewed; the hub does not write it.** *Why:* the
   hub's context is the stage's memory; spending it on code costs the plan, and a hub reviewing its own code is not a
   review.
5. **A review of one artifact runs at most 3 rounds.** After that only blockers with a concrete failure scenario are
   accepted; the hub decides and records `ask decided`. *Why:* later rounds find style, not bugs, and each costs a
   full read.
6. **Write the handoff at a context size fixed in advance — about a third of the model's context window** (~350k
   tokens on a 1M-token window, ~70k on 200k), not when the context is nearly spent. *Why:* the handoff itself and the
   last turns need room, and quality drops well before the window is full. Put your number in `hub-rules.md` if it
   differs.
7. **Evidence before claims.** Before stating a fact about data or systems, look it up (a query, a command, a
   sub-agent with the schema in its brief). A negative result counts only with a positive control on the same query.
   *Why:* a search that cannot find anything reads exactly like "there is none".
8. **Money and anything that leaves the team go to the owner** as `ask add` with a default action, not as the hub's
   decision — unless a standing permission in the owner's own words names them (`ask allow --list`). *Why:* they are the decisions that cannot be undone by the next commit.
9. **Agree the business result before you brief** (above). *Why:* a silent assumption about the result produces
   confident work on the wrong problem; details the owner left open belong to the hub.
10. **A change gets the review its class says** (`hub reviewer --for <class>`): `docs` — documentation, or tooling and
    configuration whose own positive and negative controls ran and are shown in the PR — gets no model review; `code`
    gets one review; `risky` (money, migrations, production, permissions) gets the same single review with its brief
    narrowed to that risk, not a second reviewer. *Why:* a review costs a full read of the diff and its context, and a
    second reviewer on the same risk mostly finds the same thing twice; a narrower brief gets more out of one reader.
11. **The reviewer is a different model from the author.** *Why:* a reader of the author's own model reads the code
    the way it was written and returns a confident summary, which reads like agreement.
12. **A question's due time is no reason to hold ready work while the owner is reachable, and never invent a gate the
    owner did not set** ("after 10:00", "after the owner looks"). Before asking about a merge, deploy or release, check
    `ask allow --list --stage <S>`: a permission in force whose words cover the case is the answer. *Why:* finished work waited overnight for a
    per-item "ok" the owner had already given, and for a time nobody had named.

## Optional modules

- **Night queue** (`<stage>/night-queue.md`, `nightq`, `templates/night-queue-template.md`): work allowed while the
  owner is away, with a permission matrix; an optional Claude Desktop scheduled task (`templates/night-nudge-task.md`)
  wakes a silent Claude hub. The queue files work with either engine; this Desktop scheduled nudge stays Claude-only.
  Codex autopilot selects the desktop request or detached CLI surface as described above.
- **Send budget** (`roles sent|budget|reset`, `AGENT_HUB_SEND_CAP`): Claude Desktop pauses a session's outgoing
  cross-session messages after 10 sends without the user typing in it. After every send — `roles sent <from> <to>`;
  at budget 0 write `jlog "@<tag> …"` instead. Terminal sessions do not need it.

## Watching agents

`agent-top` is a live console (curses) of every agent: state, current action, last words, unread inbox, locks, owner
questions and plan limits; `agent-top --once` prints the same picture as text; `agent-top --json` is for scripts. In Claude Code (2.1.287 or
later) the person types `/agent-top` for a live read-only side pane. Where mods do not draw (Codex, VS Code chat,
`claude -p`, Remote Control views) there is no `/agent-top`: use the console in a shell.
